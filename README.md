# README — Vardin: The Sundered World  
*A Dungeons & Dragons Campaign Setting*  

---

## 🌍 Welcome to Vardin  

Two hundred years ago, **the Slip** tore reality open. From its rift crawled the **Dwellers** 👁️ — alien horrors that nearly ended the world. When the storms cleared, the Dwellers were gone… but so was the old order.  

In their place rose the **Argyles** 💎 — strange crystal growths that granted visions, power, and the ability to twist nature into impossible forms. The guilds that mastered them — called the **Synthesis** ⚙️ — reshaped the world, for better or worse.  

Now, the powers of Vardin balance on a knife’s edge ⚔️. Centuries of fragile peace may be ending, and the Synthesis guilds hold the key to the future.

## 🎨 Core Themes  

- **Weird Renaissance** – Magic-infused technology fuels cities 🏙️, airships 🚢, and wonder… but also greed, espionage 🕵️, and arms races.  
- **Post-Cataclysm Tensions** – Nations remember the Slip and fear it might happen again.  
- **Faction Intrigue** – Guilds, pirates ☠️, and secret societies plot behind every throne 👑.  
- **Adventure Across Divides** – From desert kingdoms 🏜️ to frozen tundras ❄️, no culture stands alone.  

---

## 🏛️ The Major Powers  

- **Lonnun** – Merchant princes 💰 and cosmopolitan trade hubs, but loyalty here is bought and sold.  
- **Florian Commonwealth** – Agricultural 🌾 and military powerhouse, rich in Synthesis production.  
- **Sceca Empire** – Industrial expansionists 🏭; old-world discipline meets cutting-edge tech.  
- **Rzan Caliphate** – Desert traders controlling vital sea lanes 🌊, guided by ancient tradition.  
- **Zhenya Confederacy** – Cold northern frontier ❄️, united by survival against the elements.  

---

## 🐍 Other Players in the Game  

- **The Anba** – Jungle tribes skilled in stealth 🕵️ and poisons ☠️, caught between survival and exploitation.  
- **Gnorl Pirates** – Warlike raiders turned black-market smugglers of Argyle shards 💎.  
- **Independent Guilds** – Free Synthesis engineers selling miracles… and weapons ⚔️.  

---

## 🗺️ Life in the Sundered World  

- **Calendar** – 12 months 📅, each 30 days; leap weeks every 6 years. Seasons can be erratic in Slip-touched regions.  
- **Travel** – Airships 🚢, caravans 🐫, and coastal clippers ⛵ connect the continents — if you can pay the tolls.  
- **Common Danger** – Unstable Argyle growths 💎, wild Dweller sightings 👁️, and sabotage between rival guilds.

## 💎 Synthesis: The Heart of Power  

Synthesis is the art of binding Argyle crystal to matter, mind, or flesh 🧬. It powers weapons ⚔️, heals the sick ❤️‍🩹, and keeps cities alight 🔆.  

- Guilds control the process — each has its own secret techniques.  
- Shards are currency 💰 as much as they are components.  
- Overuse warps the land 🌍… and sometimes the user.
