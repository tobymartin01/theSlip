README — Vardin: The Sundered World
A Dungeons & Dragons Campaign Setting
Welcome to Vardin
Two hundred years ago, the Slip tore reality open. From its rift crawled the Dwellers, alien horrors that nearly ended the world. When the storms cleared, the Dwellers were gone — but so was the old order.
In their place rose the Argyles, strange crystal growths that granted visions, power, and the ability to twist nature into impossible forms. The guilds that mastered them — called the Synthesis — reshaped the world, for better or worse.

Now, the powers of Vardin balance on a knife’s edge. Centuries of fragile peace may be ending, and the Synthesis guilds hold the key to the future.

Core Themes
Weird Renaissance – Magic-infused technology fuels cities, airships, and wonder… but also greed, espionage, and arms races.
Post-Cataclysm Tensions – Nations remember the Slip and fear it might happen again.
Faction Intrigue – Guilds, pirates, and secret societies plot behind every throne.
Adventure Across Divides – From desert kingdoms to frozen tundras, no culture stands alone.
The Major Powers
Lonnun – Merchant princes and cosmopolitan trade hubs, but loyalty here is bought and sold.
Florian Commonwealth – Agricultural and military powerhouse, rich in Synthesis production.
Sceca Empire – Industrial expansionists; old-world discipline meets cutting-edge tech.
Rzan Caliphate – Desert traders controlling vital sea lanes, guided by ancient tradition.
Zhenya Confederacy – Cold northern frontier, united by survival against the elements.
Other Players in the Game
The Anba – Jungle tribes skilled in stealth and poisons, caught between survival and outside exploitation.
Gnorl Pirates – Warlike raiders turned black-market smugglers of Argyle shards.
Independent Guilds – Free Synthesis engineers selling miracles… and weapons.
Life in the Sundered World
Calendar – 12 months, each 30 days; leap weeks every 6 years. Seasons can be erratic in Slip-touched regions.
Travel – Airships, caravans, and coastal clippers connect the continents — if you can pay the tolls.
Common Danger – Unstable Argyle growths, wild Dweller sightings, and sabotage between rival guilds.
Synthesis: The Heart of Power
Synthesis is the art of binding Argyle crystal to matter, mind, or flesh. It powers weapons, heals the sick, and keeps cities alight.
Guilds control the process — each has its own secret techniques.
Shards are currency as much as they are components.
Overuse warps the land… and sometimes the user.
Your Role as Adventurers
You might be:
Guild agents in a shadow war.
Pirates chasing a shard shipment.

Where you go from there is up to you — but remember:
The Slip wasn’t the end. It was the beginning.
Getting Started

Levels – The campaign starts at Level 3, where the dangers (and rewards) truly begin.
Session 0 – We’ll establish character ties, faction loyalties, and shared history.
GM’s Note
Keep your eyes open. The truth behind the Slip is still out there — and it’s watching.
